# Contributing to Google Pub/Sub Client in Golang

## Introduction

Greetings, kind Contributor! As with any tale of heroism, the protagonists are never solely to thank; often, it's a collective effort that shapes the story. We are delighted to welcome you to contribute to this endeavour. Before you embark on this journey, please take a moment to review these guidelines, which act as a map of sorts to this project.

## Code of Conduct

As members of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute. Please refer to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for further details.

## Getting Started

Firstly, you'd want to fork this repository and clone it to your local development environment. Follow the installation steps outlined in the [README](README.md) to set up the project.

## Pull Requests

1. **Fork the Repository**: Ensure you have your own version of the project, which will allow you to freely experiment without affecting the original codebase.
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch to work on. It‚Äôs good practice to name your branch descriptively.
3. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes and write commit messages that follow the conventional commits standard.
4. **Push to GitHub**: Push your changes to your remote repository on GitHub.
5. **Open a Pull Request**: From the original repository, click the "New pull request" button. Ensure that you are comparing your newly created branch to the appropriate branch on the main repository.
6. **Code Review**: Once your pull request is opened, maintainers and contributors will review your code for any necessary changes.
7. **Merge**: Once your code has been reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the main repository.

## Issues

If you discover an issue or have a suggestion, kindly create a GitHub Issue, but first ensure there isn't an existing issue addressing the problem. Be as descriptive as possible and use relevant tags.

## Coding Style

- Follow the idiomatic Go best practices.
- Code should pass the linting standards set by golangci-lint.

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request, make sure that your code passes all the unit tests. New features should also be accompanied by adequate tests to validate their functionality.

## Documentation

All methods and functionalities must be properly documented, and the README should be updated to reflect any major changes.

## Acknowledgements

Your contribution, like a subplot in an intricate novel, adds value to the greater narrative, and for that, we extend our sincere appreciation.

---

May your contribution enrich this codebase, just as a well-placed metaphor enriches a novel. We look forward to reviewing your pull requests and issues.

Yours faithfully,
Bjornaer. üìöüë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª
